 * @mainpage SharedHashFile (S)hared Memory (H)ash Table Using (F)iles (SHF) & IPC queue
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * SharedHashFile is a lightweight NoSQL key value store / hash table, &
 * a zero-copy IPC queue library written in C for Linux. There is no
 * server process. Data is read and written directly from/to shared
 * memory or SSD; no sockets are used between SharedHashFile and the
 * application program. APIs for C, C++, & nodejs.
 *
 * ![Nailed It](http://simonhf.github.io/sharedhashfile/images/10m-tps-nailed-it.jpeg)
 *
 * @section kv_sec Key Value Store / Hash Table
 *
 * What makes SHF different from other key value stores?
 * - Exists in shared memory and avoids C pointers.
 * - Expands gracefully without having to rehash all keys.
 * - Hash table is 64 bit but only uses 32 bit offsets to save space.
 * - Uses lock sharding to minimize lock contention.
 * - Uses high performance, fair, read write spin locks.
 * - Every key stored can be accessed by the key or a 32 bit UID.
 * - Can be incrementally updated without suffering from memory holes.
 *
 * What does the SHF folder structure look like?
 * - In the example below the SHF instance is named `myname`.
 * - There is a folder called `myname.shf`.
 *   - This folder can be on `/dev/shm` or on an SSD.
 *   - Deleting this folder deletes the SHF instance.
 * - A file called `myname.shf` holding global data, e.g. locks.
 * - There are 256 'window' folders.
 * - Each window folder contains up to 2,048 'tables'.
 * - Each table contains up to 8192 keys.
 * - The maximum files in the folder are 256 * 2,048 = 524,288 files.
 * - The maximum keys storable are 256 * 2,048 * 8,192 = 2^32 keys.
 * - In each window, tables 1 to 2047 get added as expansion occurs.
 *
 * @code
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/myname.shf    <-- global data, e.g. locks
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/000/
 * - ...
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/255/          <-- 256 windows
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/000/0000.tab
 * - ...
 * - /dev/shm/myname.shf/000/2047.tab  <-- 2,048 tables
 * @endcode
 *
 * What does a table file look like?
 * - A fixed part part holds key reference data in 512 rows.
 * - Each new key value is appended to the growable data part.
 * - If new key meta data does not fit in a row, expansion occurs:
 *   - The table is split into two tables.
 *   - About half the keys remain in one table, the rest in the other.
 *   - Rehashing keys never happens to save CPU.
 *   - Keys are copied during the split; deleted keys not copied.
 *   - Due to the 8,192 key limit then splitting uses little CPU.
 *
 * @code
 * +---+---+---+---+---+
 * |   |   |   |   |   |  Fixed sized meta data for 8,192 keys
 * |  0|  1| ..|511|512|  512 rows of 16 key references

 * +---+---+---+---+---+
 * @endcode
 *
 * Walk me through what happens when adding a key and value:
 * - The key is hashed producing indexes for window, table, and row.
 * - Because the table count grows, table index is looked up indirectly.
 * - The necessary window is locked aka lock sharding.
 * - The necessary table is memory mapped if not already mapped.
 * - Find a free slot in the row for the key reference data.
 * - If no free slot found then split table and find again.
 * - Add key reference to row; append key value data to growable data.
 * - The key UID (window|table|row|slot) is returned.
 * - The 32 bit key UID can be used for key access without hashing.
 *
 * How does the indirect table index work?
 * - A per-window array holds the maximum 2,048 table indexes.
 * - If there is only 1 table then all values are initially 0.
 * - If table 0 splits, half of the 0 values become 1.
 * - If table 1 splits, half of the 1 values become 2.
 * - If table 0 splits again, half of the 0 values become 3.
 * - And so on...
 *
 * How does the fair read write locking work?
 * - Any number of threads or processes can read at the same time.
 * - Only one thread or process can write at one time.
 * - Read or write starvation cannot occur due to a ticketing system.
 * - Threads should be pinned to CPU cores to avoid context switching.
 *
 * How can I access value bytes if the memory address changes?
 * - The shared memory address of a key or value can change any time.
 *   - E.g. another process might trigger a table split simultaneously.
 * - Therefore most API functions return a copy of the key value data.
 * - It is possible to get the direct memory address of key value data:
 *   - But do not add or delete any more keys to ensure no table splits.
 *   - Only table splits cause addresses to change.
 *   - todo: Allow large key value data to exist outside of tables.
 *   - E.g. IPC queues and logging use shared memory directly.
 *
 * @section ipc_sec Zero-Copy IPC Queues
 *
 * Which data structures are used by SHF IPC queues?
 * - Create an array of x fixed-sized (caller decides) queue items.
 * - The index to a particular queue item is called a qiid.
 * - Create y queues (think: queue item states).
 * - A queue is called a qid.
 * - All qiids are initially pushed onto qid #0.
 * - A qid can be given a name (key) to identify it:
 *   - e.g. qid #0: "qid-free".
 *   - e.g. qid #1: "qid-a2b".
 *   - e.g. qid #2: "qid-b2a".
 *
 * @code
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 * |   |   |     |   |   |  Array of x queue items of size s bytes
 * |  0|  1|     |x-1|  x|  indexed by (q)ueue (i)tem (ID) aka qiid
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 *
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 * |   |   |     |   |   |  Array of y queues (double linked lists)
 * |  0|  1|     |y-1|  y|  indexed by (q)ueue (ID) aka qid
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 * |  0|                    All qiids are pushed onto qid 0
 * +---+
 * :   :
 * +---+
 * |  x|
 * +---+
 * @endcode
 *
 * Abstract example of moving a qiid from qid #0 to qid #1:
 * - Pull next qiid from the tail of qid #0.
 * - Push      qiid onto     head of qid #1.
 *
 * @code
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 * |   |   |     |   |   |  Array of y queues (double linked lists)
 * |  0|  1|     |y-1|  y|  indexed by (q)ueue (ID) aka qid
 * +---+---+- - -+---+---+
 * |  1|  0|                qiid pulled from qid 0 is pushed onto qid 1

 *
 * How is this useful for IPC between `Process A` & `Process B`?:
 * - Both the queue items and queues exist in shared memory.
 * - Queue items themselves never need to be copied (aka zero copy):
 *   - `Process A` might write bytes into shared memory @ qiid #0.
 *   - `Process B` might read  bytes from shared memory @ qiid #0.
 * - Pushing/pulling qiids to/from qids updates double linked lists.
 * - Example of IPC of a qiid from `Process A` to `Process B` and back:
 *   - `Process A` might pull a   qiid from "qid-free".
 *   - `Process A` might push the qiid onto "qid-a2b".
 *   - `Process B` might pull the qiid from "qid-a2b".
 *   - `Process B` might push the qiid onto "qid-b2a".
 *   - `Process A` might pull the qiid from "qid-b2a".
 *   - `Process A` might push the qiid onto "qid-free".
 * - There does not need to be only 3 qids as in this example.
 * - The number and/or name of qids is defined by the caller.
 * - A more complicated example might have (chains of?) more processes
 *   and/or fewer processes and more qids (think: states).
 * - The number of qids and qiids is only limited by available memory.
 * - Between pulling & pushing a qiid then it 'belongs' to no qid.
 *   - This is when the shared memory @ qiid can be accessed safely.
 *
 * How many qiids per second can be pulled & pushed between 2 processes?
 * - On a Lenovo W530 then ~ 90 million per second; C(++) <-> C(++).
 * - On a Lenovo W530 then ~ 7 million per second; C(++) <-> nodejs.
 * - Note: Figures based upon minimal qid memory access.
 * - Note: Figures based upon the hybrid shf_q_push_head_pull_tail().
 *
 * Performance notes / how these figures were achieved:
 * - Pushing or pulling requires an expensive lock for each operation.
 * - So 1 million pushes & 1 million pulls == 2 million locks total.
 * - However, the hybrid shf_q_push_head_pull_tail() uses 1 lock.
 * - So 1 million hybrid calls == 1 million locks total.
 * - However, shf_q_new() takes `qids_nolock_max`:
 *   - Each queue caller (e.g. `Process A`) has an own pre-queue.
 *   - This pre-queue is unlocked and contains `qids_nolock_max` items.
 *   - Upon containing `qids_nolock_max` items then:
 *     - A lock is taken.
 *     - And `qids_nolock_max` items are moved to the qid.
 *     - Only double linked list ends are updated to move many items.
 *   - Therefore, if `qids_nolock_max` is set to 1,000 then:
 *     - 1 million hybrid calls == only 1,000 locks total.
 *   - The lockless pre-queues are not stored in shared memory.
 * - The architecture is designed for maximum possible performance.
 *
 * Suggestion for caller hybrid poll / notification approach:
 * - Processes poll for (& expect there to be) a new qiid to pull.
 * - E.g. similar to how a busy NIC driver polls for the next packet.
 * - For non-busy pollers, consider multi stage notification, e.g.:
 *   - Process greedily polls until nothing left to poll.
 *   - Use much slower OS notification mechanism to batch notify:
 *     - E.g. let's say OS mechanism only manages 100k per second.
 *     - But SHF IPC queues manages 90 millon per second.
 *     - So pusher only need notify every 90M / 100k == 900 items.
 *     - Otherwise throughput will lower to unwanted 100k per second.
 *   - Use poller timer to sweep for last item sent.
 *     - i.e. pusher sent 2 items in last single OS notify period.
 *
 * Suggestion for run-time order of operations / pattern:
 * - `Process A` wants to IPC with (not yet started) `Process B`.
 * - `Process A` creates unique SHF instance for later `Process B` IPC.
 * - `Process A` creates necessary IPC queue in the unique SHF instance.
 * - `Process A` spawns `Process B`; telling SHF instance to attach to.
 * - `Process B` uses the queue embedded into the attached SHF instance.
 * - `Process A` & `Process B` 'queue nirvana' at up to 90 million TPS.
 * - `Process A` eventually exits and cleanly tells `Process B` to exit.
 * - `Process A` deletes the SHF instance after `Process B` exited.
 * - `Process A` exits.
 * - Notes:
 *   - `Process A` has created the unique SHF & its queue before
 *     `Process B` exists so there is no race condition.
 *   - The IPC queue is only used while both processes are alive.
 *   - It is left up to `Process A` to decide how to communicate the SHF
 *     instance to `Process B` (e.g. command line argument?).
 *   - It is left up to `Process A` to decide that `Process B` is no
 *     longer using the SHF instance, so that the SHF instance can be
 *     deleted.
 *   - If `Process B` exits (e.g. unexpectedly) then it should not be
 *     expected that `Process A` can launch another `Process B` to
 *     continue where the old `Process B` left off. This is because of
 *     `qids_nolock_max`; see above.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - Once shf_q_new() or shf_q_get() has been called then the key value
 *   store should no longer be used, or a seg fault might result. This
 *   limitation will be fixed in a future update.
